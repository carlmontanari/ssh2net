# Contributing

This was created as a learning project, so contributions are not expected, but are very welcome! Feel free to open PRs or Issues as needed. Any contributions would need to at a minimum successfully complete a tox run since there is no CI at this point.

Between tox and the Makefile, I hope that testing should be pretty easy, with a big caveat that you will need to get vrnetlab setup and working for functional testing to occur in a reasonable and repeatable fashion.
